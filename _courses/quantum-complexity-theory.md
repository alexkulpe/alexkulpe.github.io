Course Description
======

This is a seminar series whose theme changes every term. It should be of interest to Master’s students of computer science, mathematics, and physics. We particularly recommend it as preparation for a thesis project in quantum information and computation.

This term, the topic will be Quantum Complexity Theory.

Themes of past semesters:

Winter 2023/24: Quantum Cryptography
Summer 2023: [Quantum Algorithms](quantum-algorithms)

Required Prior Knowledge
======

Students should have successfully completed our two lecture courses [Quantum Information and Computation](quantum-information-and-computation) and [Advanced Quantum Information and Computation](advanced-quantum-information-and-computation).

Literature
======

The main reference will be Sev Gharibian’s [lecture notes](https://groups.uni-paderborn.de/fg-qi/courses/UPB_QCOMPLEXITY/2024/notes/QCT_Masterfile.pdf). The first two chapters cover material that you should are already be familiar with.
