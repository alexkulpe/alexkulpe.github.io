Course Description
======

This topical course is meant as a follow-up to our introductory course Quantum Information and Computation and aimed at students interested in deepening their knowledge in this area.
We plan to cover selected topics in quantum information and computation, e.g. how to model quantum channels, analyze nonlocal games, design quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols, and obtain insights into which problems are easy and which are likely hard even for quantum computers.
Students interested in a Masterâ€™s project in quantum information, computing, cryptography, etc. are particularly encouraged to participate. 
This course should be of interest to students of computer science, mathematics, physics, and related disciplines.

Topics to be covered will likely included:
* Quantum states and measurements beyond a first course
* Multiple quantum systems, partial trace, purification
* Distance measures
* Non-local games
* XOR & binary constraint system games
* Self-testing, rigidity, Gowers-Hatami
* Quantum channels
* One-shot compression
* Asymptotic compression
* Entropy, mutual information, Holevo bound
* Quantum Key Distribution
* Monogamy of entanglement
* ...
