Course Description
======

The lecture deepens and supplements the knowledge from the lecture on data structures.
Specifically, we look at different algorithm paradigms, i.e. schemes for designing efficient algorithms. 
For this purpose, we first look at the already known paradigms incremental, divide-and-conquer, and greedy and apply them to different problems.
Building on this, we learn about dynamic programming, as well as the methods backtracking and branch-and-bound.
We also look at a paradigm specifically for geometric problems: the sweepline method

Preliminaries
======

Basic lecture on algorithms and data structures, such as Computer Science 2.

Literature
======

The lecture is mainly based on the following sources:
* Jon Kleinberg, Eva Tardos. Algorithm Design. Pearson Education
* Further references will be given in the lecture.

Exam
======

The final examination takes the form of an end-of-semester exam. 
This applies to all students. 
Only those who register with their examination office in due time can take the exam.
If you have any questions, please contact your examination office directly.

CERTIFICATE OF ATTENDANCE
======

You will receive an ungraded certificate of successful participation if you achieve at least half of the homework points, calculate at least once in the exercises and regularly take part in the exercises.
