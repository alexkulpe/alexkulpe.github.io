Hello there! 
After studying [Mathematics](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/) and [IT-Security](https://informatik.rub.de/en/) I am deepening my knowledge in Quantum Information and Cryptography as a PhD Student in the [Quantum Information group](https://michaelwalter.info) at [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en) and [CASA - Cybersecurity in the Age of Large-Scale Adversaries](https://casa.rub.de/en/).
I am jointly supervised by [Prof. Dr. Michael Walter](https://https://michaelwalter.info/walter) from LMU Munich and [Asst. Prof. Dr. Giulio Malavolta](https://sites.google.com/view/giuliomalavolta/) from [Bocconi University](https://unibocconi.it) and [Max-Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org).

I am generally interested in Cryptography, Cryptanalysis, Theoretical Computer Science and Quantum Information.
